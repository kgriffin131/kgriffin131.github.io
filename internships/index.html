			</div>
				<p id="title">This page highlights my internship experience. Since most of my project work with both companies are covered under various NDA agreements, I cannot share the specifics of the work I have previously done. However, I have collected the feedback documents from each of my internships and compiled that information into this portion of my website. I have exported the quotes from each of my previous managers/mentors to showcase my strengths, weaknesses, and growth over time. I have also included the original review files to ensure the reader that the information I have included is accurate.</p>

				<p id="title"><b>NASA OStem Internship: Janurary - August 2021 (2 terms)</b></p>
			</div>
				<p id="title">This internship experience was done over the course of the Spring and Summer 2021 terms. Originally, the internship was to be worked for just the Spring 2021 semester, but I recieved a return offer for the Summer. I also recieved a return offer to work part-time during the Fall 2021 semester, but turned it down to give myself the best chance academically. NASA employees do not normally give end-of-intership reviews, but I convinced my mentor to give me one through Iowa State University's system.</p>
			</div>
				<p id="title">NASA employees do not normally give end-of-intership reviews, but I convinced my mentor to give me one through Iowa State University's system. This system allows the intern and the mentor to fill out the form seperately, and shows a comparison between the mentor and self evaluation. The chart seen below shows this comparison. The higher the rating, the closer to the border the points will be. Because this internship was virtual, there were some portions of the review that were not applicable.</p>

				<p id="title">As one can see, I ranked fairly high across the board. Areas where my mentor (red) felt I excelled (5+) were my Communication Skills, Quality Orientation, Professional Impact, Planning, Integrity, and General Knowledge. All other ratings were a 4 or above. The link below will show the full report and contains more details about how each section of the report was scored.</p>

				<p id="title"><b>The Timken Company: Process Design and Development Engineering Internship Summer 2020</b></p>
			</div>
				<p id="title">The Timken Company is located across the globe and manufacures high quality bearings for just about every mechanical market. This internship was located at the World Headquarters in North Canton, Ohio, and I was positioned in the Process Design and Development department. This department deals with the efficiency and technical aspects of manufacuring processes within bearing plants. My specific job entailed the following: Creating and revising engineering drawings using an in-house automation system to be used in plants worldwide, Correcting and adding features to 3D models (Siemens NX) created by the automation system, Worked with data (JMP) to assist in cutting heat treat process timing down by 20%, and Networked with more full-time employees to further my knowledge of the company and industry. This internship was worked during the start of Covid, and consisted of in-person and remote work. At the end of the internship term, I was reviewed by my manager based on goals set at the beginning 				of the term. Below are direct quotes from this evaluation, and the full evaluation is linked at the bottom of this section. I have excluded the last names of individuals to keep information private./p>
			</div>
				<p id="title">"The feedback I received from Ian and Tom (co-workers) is Kevin's abilities and contributions to NX related work was excellent. Kevin was a VERY QUICK LEARNER and TOOK DIRECTIONS VERY WELL. His performance for this category was well above expectation. I recommend "Exceeded" rating for this goal." - Ron D. (manager) in reference to the main internship project.</p>
			</div>
				<p id="title">"At this point I wish Kevin could return in the fall when the work environment is more normal. Based on positive feedback from Tom M. and Ian H. (co-workers) regarding Kevin's abilities, I feel this summer session was a missed opportunity for Kevin and Timken. KEVIN IS ONE OF OUR EXCEPTIONAL CO-OPS, AND HOPE HE RETURNS TO TIMKEN FOR FUTURE SESSIONS." - Ron D. (manager) when asked for additional comments.</p>
			</div>
				<p id="title">"Kevin has VERY GOOD MIX OF PERSONAL SKILLS to work with associates with varied backgrounds and experience. Tom and Ian (co-workers) enjoyed working with Kevin." - Ron D. (manager) when asked about soft skills.</p>
			</div>
				<p id="title">"Kevin has a bright future to look forward to. ALREADY THINKS LIKE A MORE EXPERIENCED ENGINEER." - Ron D. (manager) when asked for additional comments.</p>
